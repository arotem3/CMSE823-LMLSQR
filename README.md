# CMSE823-LMLSQR

## Research Plan
1. Implement Newton, Gauss-Newton, LM Algorithms in Julia.
2. Test each algorithm on a least-squares problem whose solution is analytically known.
3. Compare the QR update strategy to repeated Cholesky or SVD factorizations for trust-region sub-problems of various sizes.
